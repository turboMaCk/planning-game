Simple voting poker implementation build with efficiency,
flexibility and easy deployment in mind.
Enabling remote teams to effectively identify complexity
and unclear requirements in collaborative way.

## Quick Start

Use free hosted service at [planning-game.com](https://planning-game.com)

### Using Container

Run official container locally:

```shell
$ docker run -p 3000:3000 --rm -it turbomack/planning-game
```

### Using Nix

> *Optionaly* one can use [Cachix cache of the project](https://app.cachix.org/cache/planning-game).
>
> Cache contains binaries for Linux x86-64 (also known as AMD64 Linux).
>
> ```shell
> $ cachix use planning-game
> ```

Install server binary:

```
$ nix-env -iA server-mini -f https://github.com/turboMaCk/planning-game/archive/master.tar.gz
```

Server serves client side assets from the file system so it should ran within directory
where client files are present. To provide them one can use nix-build:

```
$ nix-build -A client https://github.com/turboMaCk/planning-game/archive/master.tar.gz
```

Nix build will create `result` symlink pointing to nix-store containing all the required client side assets.
You can then just run server within this directory:

```
$ cd result; planning-game
```

Server will run on http://localhost:3000
